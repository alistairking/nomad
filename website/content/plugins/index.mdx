# External Plugins and Tools

## External Plugins

Nomad 0.9 introduced a plugin framework which allows users to extend the
functionality of some components within Nomad. The design of the plugin system
is inspired by the lessons learned from plugin systems implemented in other
HashiCorp products such as Terraform and Vault.

The following components are currently pluggable within Nomad:

- [Task Drivers](/plugins/drivers)
- [Devices](/plugins/devices)

## External Tools

External tools provide additional capabilities and use cases to Nomad. They are
installed separately from Nomad itself and can sometimes be deployed as a Nomad
job in your cluster.

The following external tools are currently available for Nomad:

- [Autoscaling](/plugins/autoscaling)
